The James Webb Space Telescope's first stunning images of the distant universe have been followed up by something a little closer to home.Data collected during the telescope's commissioning period, before its science operations officially started on July 12, have been released on the Space Telescope Science Institute's website. The publicly available data is now ready for scientists around the world to study.That data includes new images of Jupiter, which were taken while the space observatory's instruments were still being tested."Combined with the deep field images released the other day, these images of Jupiter demonstrate the full grasp of what Webb can observe, from the faintest, most distant observable galaxies to planets in our own cosmic backyard that you can see with the naked eye from your actual backyard," said Bryan Holler, a scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, in a statement.Holler helped with the planning for the observations.
Webb is an infrared telescope, so it captures light that is invisible to the human eye. One of Webb's images of Jupiter shows the giant planet's telltale atmospheric bands as well as the Great Red Spot.This famous feature is a massive storm about twice the size of Earth that has churned for over a century. It looks white in the image due to the processing of the infrared image.The search for life on Mars and ocean worlds in our solar system.
